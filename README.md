# Web Portfolio Project
#### Welcome to my personal Web Portfolio Pet Project, a full-stack web app developed using Flask (Python), along with HTML5 and CSS3! This project showcases my learning journey in building responsive, interactive, and server-connected websites.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
###âœ… Flask Basics
- How to define routes using @app.route.
- How to use render_template() to serve HTML files.
- Handling both GET and POST methods to process forms.
- Writing to CSV files as a simple database for submissions.

### âœ… HTML & CSS
- How to build a structured website layout.
- Navigational bars, header sections, and responsive image integration.
- How to customize pre-built templates.
- Linking pages using \<a href="page.html">.

###âœ… Clean Code Practices
- Replaced hardcoded routes with one dynamic route (/\<string:page_name>) to keep code DRY.
- Separated logic into functions (write_to_csv) for reusability.


## ðŸŽ¯ To-Do & Future Plans
 - Integrate email notifications using Flask-Mail
 - Add JavaScript interactivity (form validation, animations)
 - Store submissions in PostgreSQL
 - Make the site mobile-optimized using media queries
